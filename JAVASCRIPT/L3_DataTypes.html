        Notes:
        What is Data Types?
        Data Types are used to specify what type of data that we want to store inside within a variable or a program. \

        Types of data types in JavaScripts:
        - String
        - Number
        - Boolean
        - Object
        - Array
        - Function

        String, Number & Boolean are primitive data type which can object store one value at one time.
        Obejct, Array & Functionare compostite data types which can store a collections os values at one time.

        JavaScript also has a few special data types such as Undefined data type and Null data type.
