    Learning 7 : Decision Making using JavaScript

    Notes:
    In our daily life, we need to deal with a lot of decision making. It is the same in programming too!
    Methods of Decision Making in JavaScript :
        1) if statement      = tell the program to execute a block of code if a specific condition is true
        2) else statement    = tell the program to execute another block of code if the same condition is false
        3) else if statement = tell the program to execute the code with new condition is the 1st condition is false
        4) switch statement  = to specify different alternative blocks of code to be executed
