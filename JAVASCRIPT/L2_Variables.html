        Learning 2 : Variables in JavaScript

        Notes:
        What is Variable?
        Variables are usually used to store data that we need to use in the whole program or webpage. We can use the variables to set,
        update and retrive data that stored in the variables whenever needed. 

        In general, varibles are the symbolic names for the values.

        Naming rules for JavaScript variables:
        - the variable name need to start with a letter, underscore(_) or dollar sing($)
        - the variable name can only contain alpha-numeric characters such as (A-z) & (0-9) or underscores
        - the variable name cannot contain any white spaces. We can use underscore(_) to indicate space
        - the variable name cannot declare by using the reserved keywords in JavaScript

        How to declare a variable?
        Step 1 : create a variable by using "var" keyword
        Step 2 : use the assignment operator (=) to assign the value to a variable
        For example: var name = "John Doe";

        We can also create the variable and assign the value afterwards. For example :
        var name;
        name = "John Doe";

        Tips of declaring a variable:
        - always give meaningful names to your variables
        - we can include camelCase if we got multiple words in a variable

            // declare the variables with the initialization
            var name = "John Doe";
            var age = 15;
            var isStudent = true;

            // declare a variable and initiatise the variable later
            var userName; // empty variable
            userName = "john123"; // assign "john123" into the userName variable

            // we can also declare multiple variables in a single by separating them using coma (,)
            var movieName = "X-Men", director = "JohnD", price = 15.00;

            // declare the variables using "let" and "const" keywords
            // "let" and "const" are having the same function but variable that created using "const" keyword can be reassigned later in the code.

            // using "let" keyword
            let charName = "Harry Potter";
            let charAge = 11;

            // using "const" keyword
            const PI = 3.14;
