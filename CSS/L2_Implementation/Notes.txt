Learning 2 : Implementation in HTML

Notes:
There are three ways of inserting style sheet into the HTML.

Ways/Methods to insert Cascading Style Sheet :
i) External CSS
- we can create an external style sheet and link the style sheet
  into the HTML file.
- we can change and style the website by coding and changing the 
  design in this external style sheet.
(refer to external.html & external.css)

ii) Internal CSS
- we can use an internal style sheet to style one single HTML page
  that has a unique style.
- to create an internal style sheet, we can use <style> element in
  the <head> session.
(refer to internal.html)

iii) Inline CSS
- this is used to style one single element only.
- usually we use Inline CSS to apply an unique style for one element.
- To add Inline CSS, we can add the style attribute into the element 
  that we want to style.
(refer to inline.html)

Cascading Order :
All the styles in a page will "cascade" into a new "virtual" style sheet by the following rules, where number one has the highest priority:

1) Inline style (inside an HTML element)
2) External and internal style sheets (in the head section)

Inline style will has the highest priority and will override the settings
in the external and internal style sheets.

Summary of the chapter :
1) External CSS - is used to style multiple HTML file
2) Internal CSS - is used to style only one HTML file
3) Inline CSS   - is used to style only one HTML element
